		// I played with a few things but can't seem to get it working. 
		
		// So for example, I need to be able to check if the 8th element of getRecordNumber(52) is true/false
		// or if the 2nd element/field matches a certain string
		
		//The looping bit I get, just cant seem to access the objects.
